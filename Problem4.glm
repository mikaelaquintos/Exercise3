// Problem 4
// 
// Create a recorder to collect hourly indoor air temperature of the house 
// from Problem 2. 
// 
// (a) What is happening during the first few hours of the simulation? 
//		The first few hours of the simulation, the house is heating up to get to the 
//		setpoint. What if it's there is no set point? 
// (b) Suggest an approach to minimizing the effect of this behavior? 
// 		Provide it an initial value to start recording.
//
// (Hint: use the air_temperature property.)

//Setup modules that will be used
module tape
module residential; //Involving a house

//Setup clock
clock {
	timezone PST+8PDT;
	starttime '2001-01-01 00:00:00 PST';
	stoptime '2001-01-29 00:00:00 PST';

//3.These objects have properties
